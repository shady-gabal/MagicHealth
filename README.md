# MagicHealth_server

Really simple proof-of-concept server built as part of a service called MagicHealth, designed to help pregnant women in developing countries receive up-to-date information and advice on how to best manage their pregnancies. 

This was meant as a proof of concept, and was built in a really short time period, so there are some shortcuts taken - hard coded API keys, for example. My team and I never ended up proceeding with this idea.
